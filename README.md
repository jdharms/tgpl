Contained within this project are my solutions to the exercises in Donvan and Kernighan's
"The Go Programming Language" book.

The code--especially in the earlier chapters--should not be regarded as especially idiomatic,
efficient, or robust with regards to error handling.  Each exercise I am attempting to solve
as much as possible using only tools and techniques presented at that point in the text.
I am learning the language myself, and not attempting to provide a collection of model solutions for reference.

It is unfortunate that testing is not covered until chapter 11--I might skip ahead to that chapter after learning the basic data types and control structures.
